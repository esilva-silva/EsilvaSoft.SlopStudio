// Presentation ports of the native agent chat (phase 7, lote 6). Shared contracts were promoted on 24/09/2026:
// provider descriptor/capabilities/status (Core/Agents + IAgentProvider.Describe/GetStatusAsync + AgentProviderCatalog),
// trusted approval details (IAgentApprovalDetailsSource, AgentEvent.ApprovalExpiresAtUtc), sanitized tool destination
// (AgentEvent.ToolDestination) and API-key writes (IAgentApiKeyStore). What remains here is presentation only: a
// synchronous, localized view of the catalog and the tab snapshot.
//
// P7-L06-WIRING (25/09/2026): the composition root (App.axaml.cs) now registers the OpenAI/Claude adapters
// (Infrastructure.Agents) and a production IAgentProviderCatalog (DesktopAgentProviderCatalog, this folder), built
// only from IAgentRuntime/AgentProviderCatalog/capabilities — no branch by provider brand. ViewModels and Views keep
// depending only on these ports; only the composition root references Infrastructure.Agents, OpenAI, Anthropic or
// ModelContextProtocol (AC-04).
//
// P7-L06-HOST (25/09/2026): the main window hosts AgentChatPanel as a collapsible right-hand surface (Ctrl+Shift+A),
// one AgentChatViewModel per workspace tab, created only when the panel is shown. AgentChatServices come from
// AgentChatServicesFactory, invoked lazily on that first explicit opening, so starting the IDE resolves no runtime,
// vault or network. IAgentApiKeyStore has a production implementation (DesktopAgentApiKeyStore, OS vault slots mapped
// by the composition root).
//
// P7-L10-WIRE (25/09/2026): IAgentApprovalDetailsSource is the AgentWriteApprovalCoordinator composed by the
// infrastructure (pending registry write proposals only); unknown or decided approvals still yield no details and the
// dialog stays fail-closed. No write tool is exposed yet (no IAgentMongoWriteSource composed).
