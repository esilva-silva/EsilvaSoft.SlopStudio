/// <see cref="IAutocompleteService.Settings"/> — the singleton that already owns the effective autocomplete
/// settings and is refreshed by the preferences window through <c>ConfigureAsync</c>, so turning the feature off
/// takes effect on the very next <c>Collect</c>, with no restart and no cached copy of its own;</description></item>
/// <item><description>the per-connection exclusion is <see cref="WorkspacePreferences.LearnedSchemaExcludedProfileIds"/>,

/// when the user toggles one connection — exactly the convention <c>IMetadataCache.SetSchemaSamplingAllowed</c> /
