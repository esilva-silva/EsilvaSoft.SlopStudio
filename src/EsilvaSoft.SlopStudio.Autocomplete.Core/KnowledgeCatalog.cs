/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Sources that share no requested kind are drained fully, in registration order, exactly like a single source would
/// be (no quota overhead, unchanged behavior). Sources that share at least one requested kind (for example two
/// sources both producing <see cref="SymbolKind.Field"/>, as <c>LearnedSchemaCatalogSource</c> will once it lands
/// in L15) form a group and are visited once each, in order, with a fair share of the remaining budget: the first
/// source registered can never consume the whole quota and hide the others. Each source is called exactly once
/// (never revisited) because <see cref="ICatalogSource"/> is not resumable — a second call to the same source with
/// the same query restarts from its first match and would duplicate candidates already in the sink. A source given
/// a smaller share than it actually has available is capped and the cut is surfaced through
/// <see cref="CatalogCompleteness.Partial"/> instead of a false <see cref="CatalogCompleteness.Complete"/>; the
/// resulting budget for a group can therefore end up smaller than <see cref="CatalogQuery.MaximumCandidates"/> when
/// an earlier source is truncated and a later one does not need the remainder — the alternative (calling sources a
/// second time to redistribute leftovers) is not safe given the non-resumable contract above. See PEND-K16-QUOTA in
/// decisions.md.
